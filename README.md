### Where to get the mod.io Unity plugin
If you'd like to install the mod.io plugin into your own project you can import it directly from the [Unity Asset Store](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/integration/mod-browser-manager-by-mod-io-138866), or by downloading the package directly from the [Releases page](https://github.com/modio/modio-unity/releases) of the plugin's repository. If you have any previous versions of the plugin installed, it is highly recommended to delete them before importing a newer version.

Alternatively, you can download an archive of the code using GitHub's download feature and place it in the Assets/Plugins directory within your Unity project.
